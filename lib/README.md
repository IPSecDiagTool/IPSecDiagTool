#Lib Folder
This folder contains the library files used in this project.
A .gitignore rule is used to prevent them from being uploaded to GitHub. So you'll
need to download the required libraries yourself and put them in this folder.
This is a temporary solution until I've written a ant or maven script that downloads the
required libraries automatically.
